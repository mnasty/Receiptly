Welcome to my Receiptly Repo!

This app is the itemized tax refunder’s dream! It will help you take photo evidence of every receipt for the government’s viewing pleasure and save data to help you track spending habits. It stores photos in one place for easy transfer to your computer so you always have plenty of free space. It will even generate a basic spending report so you can see the data all in one neat, virtual space. Say goodbye to paper and say hello to Receiptly!
